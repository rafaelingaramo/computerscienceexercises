# Computer Science Data Structures Library

## Overview
This project contains implementations of various fundamental data structures, written in Java. These data structures serve as building blocks for solving computational problems, and can be used in practical applications like algorithm design, system development, and coding exercises.

## Classes

### 1. **ArrayList**
This class provides a dynamic array implementation that allows resizing during runtime. It includes features such as:
- Adding and removing elements.
- Retrieving elements by index.
- Dynamically resizing storage when needed.

### 2. **LinkedList**
This class implements a doubly linked list, enabling insertions and deletions in constant time. Features include:
- Sequential access to nodes.
- Support for both forward and backward traversal.
- Efficient add/remove operations at both ends of the list.

### 3. **BinaryTree**
A binary tree implementation that follows Binary Search Tree (BST) rules for efficient insertion, deletion, and search operations. Features include:
- Tree visualization for debugging and understanding structure.
- In-order traversal for accessing elements in sorted order.
- Node addition while maintaining BST properties.

### 4. **Map**
An implementation of a key-value pair mapping structure, commonly known as a dictionary or associative array. Features include:
- Fast lookup operations by key.
- Support for adding, updating, and removing key-value pairs.
- Handling collisions with an appropriate strategy (e.g., chaining or open addressing).

### 5. **Queue**
A first-in, first-out (FIFO) data structure that supports the following operations:
- Enqueue: Add elements to the rear of the queue.
- Dequeue: Remove elements from the front of the queue.
- Peek: Retrieve the element at the front of the queue without removing it.

### 6. **Stack**
A last-in, first-out (LIFO) data structure that enables:
- Push: Adding elements to the top of the stack.
- Pop: Removing elements from the top of the stack.
- Peek: Viewing the top element without removal.

## Requirements
- **JDK 8 or higher**
- **Java IDE** such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or Visual Studio Code.

## How to Use
Each class is self-contained and can be used independently in your Java projects. Example usage for each data structure can be found in their respective code or documentation comments.

1. Import the desired package or class into your Java project.
2. Instantiate the class with necessary parameters (if any).
3. Use the provided methods for interactions, such as adding and removing elements, searching for data, etc.
